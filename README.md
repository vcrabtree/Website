# Website

This website was created as a personal website intended to be used as a portfolio of my work and acheivements. This website was programmed using HTML/CSS with a Bootstrap 4 framework.

## Components

There are three tabs on this website. The first is the home page, which consists of background information on me. Below this gereral information is a form that allows an individual to send me an email. This is implemented through a website called Formspree. The next tab is titled "Projects" and discusses some of the major programs I have implemented. Each project includes a brief description as well as a link to the Github repository. The final tab on the website is the "Resume" tab and links to a PDF of my current resume.
